Looking forward to the day I upload a post saying “I’m moving to Africa.” 🌞✨🦋💖 — It’s amazing how the very place I used to be ashamed of as a young child is now the place I hold so close to my heart. From the music I listen to, to the way I’ve decorated my home. I think Africa is such a rich and beautiful continent. I still have a lot of countries to visit but soon I’ll be embarking on a 3 week trip visiting Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique and Botswana. This is the trip of my DREAMS and I get to take you along with me! What a blessing. Comment below if you live in any of those places or have any recommendations. 🌞✨🦋🥭🍊💖 #TravelAfrica #Africa #Namibia #Botswana #Zimbabwe
