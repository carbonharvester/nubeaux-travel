“I wasn’t born in Africa but it was born within me..” — There are still SO many places I want to visit like Mozambique in particular Vilankulos, the deserts in Namibia, the beaches in Mauritius and so many more places. I feel alive whenever I’m on the Motherland. I know I’ll probably move here in a few years, I can feel it.. ✨🌞🦋💖 #niaTHELIGHT
