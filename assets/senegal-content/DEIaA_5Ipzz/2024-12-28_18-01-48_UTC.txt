I didn’t get to meet my Grandmother as she died before I was born. When I arrived at Gorée Island I saw this beautiful Queen selling some traditional Senegalese desserts and I admired her from afar. Hours later, @hawo_kane arrived and we wandered around shooting. I coincidentally packed this dress I bought at a market the day before and when Hawo began speaking to Ms. Fatou, she began complimenting me and allowed me to shoot with her. I remembered my dress and had a desire to wear it l. I didn’t have anywhere to change but she let me into her home. In that short encounter, I got a glimpse into my African Grandmothers love. It felt so safe and warm. I didn’t plan to shoot this at all but the photos that we took together are my favourite of all time. Thank you Ms. Fatou for this sentimental memory I won’t ever forget. 🌞✨💛🇸🇳 #Senegal #niaTHELIGHT
