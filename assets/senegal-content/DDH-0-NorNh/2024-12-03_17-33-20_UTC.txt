Na nga def Senegal. 🌞✨🇸🇳💛 — This is my last trip of the year and my spirit is so happy to be back in Africa. Today I visited Gorée Island which was once a hub for transporting enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. Now, it has museums that tell the story and locals that sell unique and beautiful art.  Visiting spaces like this is a reminder of the journey our ancestors took and how we should take advantage of the limitless possibilities we now have in their honour. #Senegal #GoreeIsland #Dakar #niaTHELIGHT #Africa
